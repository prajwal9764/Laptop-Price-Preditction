# Laptop-Price-Preditction
This project uses Python and various regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications. The model was optimized using techniques such as feature engineering, and various libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn were used for data manipulation and model building.

# Data
The dataset used for this project was collected from various online retailers and contains information on various laptop specifications such as processor speed, RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and brand. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the dataset to identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Model Building
After conducting EDA, regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were trained and optimized using techniques such as feature engineering. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn were incorporated to better understand the data and improve model performance.

# Model Evaluation
The final model was evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and mean absolute error, achieving an R2 score of 0.80-0.88.

# Deployment
The final model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input their own laptop specifications and receive a predicted price.
